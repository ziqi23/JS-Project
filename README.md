Background:

    For this project I will be creating an interactive data visualization website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will be leveraging public APIs to source economic data including recent trends in inflation by country, CPI by category, changes in salary and FX changes together to see how buying power has increased or decreased in the past years. 

    Once data has been sourced and vetted, I will be utilizing D3.js to implement models such as line graphs or bar graphs to present the information in unique ways. I will also be using the three.js library to introduce another dimension to my website and analyses. Finally, I will be introducing interactivity by hiding certain charts behind regions of the globe where the user might select and behind customized HTML buttons which serve up information as requested. I will additionally attempt to make the data itself interactive allowing the user to zoom in on a specific quarter or period of time and examine a zoomed in version of the data.
